\title{Tunnels to Towers: Secure Virtual Private Networking for CCN}


\maketitle


\begin{abstract}
Content Centric Networking (CCN) is a future Internet architecture which is envisioned as an alternative to the current IP-based model. CCN emphasizes content distribution by making contents directly addressable in a request-based information centric network. An advantage of CCN is that it has some innate privacy friendly features, such as lack of source and destination addresses in packets. However, to be considered a viable future Internet architecture, CCN must offer services for private and anonymous communication that are at least equivalent for  to those present in the IP architecture. Among such, VPNs are a very popular application that enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the same private network. In this work we design, implement and evaluate CCVPN, a content centric virtual private network capable of providing the same functionality of VPNs within the CCN Internet architecture. To the best of our knowledge CCVPN is the first proposal of a VPN alike service for CCNs. In addition to the CCVPN design, we also provide a security analysis and experimental performance evaluation for this new system.
